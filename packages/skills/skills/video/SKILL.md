# Video

Create or transform a single video clip from a prompt, image, keyframes, or reference video. Supported intents include generation, transformation, restyling, extension, enhancement, trimming, retiming, and preparation for timeline authoring.

## Method

1. Separate single-clip creation or transformation from timeline-wide editing, which belongs to video-editing and Cut authoring.
2. Preserve stable source, start-frame, and end-frame references together with motion, camera, duration, audio, and style intent.
3. Negotiate explicit adapter support and limits before execution. End-frame conditioning, restyling, enhancement, or extension must never be assumed.
4. Return visible degraded or unsupported diagnostics when the requested semantics cannot be honored.
5. Claim a generated or transformed clip only from a confirmed runtime capability result. Before confirmation, report only planned, submitted, pending, blocked, or failed state.
6. Validate the returned clip structurally and technically at operation scope. Broader visual consistency and final-cut approval require media-quality-review evidence.
